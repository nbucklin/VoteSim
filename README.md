# VoteSim
Democratic vote share simulation over 44 weeks

Uses Monte Carlo simulation to plot democratic vote share for each state over 44 weeks. Each state is subject to the same national swing and a state-specific swing. These are modeled as random variables. Results of the simulation are plotted, with states right around the 50% margin highlighted. These states are further explored in a graph that visualizes their probability of having a vote share greater than 50%.
